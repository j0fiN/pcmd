## About
During development :fontawesome-solid-laptop-code:, it can be frustrating,  

- to type long commands when you start up the terminal :material-console-line: for the day (or when a terminal shuts down due to unknown reasons!) or,
- to type a set of terminal :material-console-line: commands repeatedly to do configuration, checks and so on.

> For these problems...

*** :fontawesome-solid-fish: pcmd*** comes in handy :thumbsup:  
It's main features are

- [x] It helps to execute commands with the user-define name :fish:  
- [x] It helps to execute multiple commands with just a single command of user-defined name :octopus:  

A single config file :octicons-file-code-16: and your ready to go :material-rocket-launch-outline: !

    ``` bash
    $ pip install pcmd

    ---> 100%
    ```

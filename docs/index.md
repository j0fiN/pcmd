## About
During daily development, it can be frustrating,

- to type long commands when you start up the terminal for the day (or when your terminal shuts down due to unknown reasons!) or,
- to type a set of terminal commands repeatedly to do configuration, checks, and so on.

> For these problems...

It's main features are

- [x] It helps to execute commands with a user-define name :fish:  
- [x] It helps to execute multiple commands with just a single user-defined name :octopus:  

A single config file :octicons-file-code-16: ...

... and your ready to go :material-rocket-launch-outline: !

=== "pip"

    ``` bash
    $ pip install pcmd

    ---> 100%
    ```

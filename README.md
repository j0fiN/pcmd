#### A super simple terminal command shortener Cli :fish:
  
 
## Usage ðŸ§°
During development, it can be frustrating to type long commands when you start up the terminal for the day or when a terminal shuts down due to unknown reasons!
There might be times when you had to type a set of long terminal commands repeatedly.  

> For all these problems...  
  
***pcmd*** comes in handy :+1:  
- It helps to execute commands with the user-define name :fish:
- It helps to execute multiple commands with just a single command of user-defined name :octopus:

## Getting started :rocket:
### Install the package :package:
Using _pip_
```sh-session
$ pip install pcmd

---> 100%
```
or from _poetry_,
```sh-session
$ poetry add pcmd

---> 100%
```
or download the  files from the [releases](https://github.com/j0fiN/pcmd/releases) :bookmark:.
### Building a `cmd.yaml` file :hammer:
Create a file `cmd.yaml` (make sure you create it with a proper text editor).  
The key will be your custom name and the value will be the terminal command.  
```<custom name>: <terminal command>```  
Here we see a simple example,
```yaml
print-hi: echo "An example of a long command depicting the usage of pcmd!"
dir-check: dir
```
### That's it! :fish:
Now (from the same directory where `cmd.yaml` exists)  type,
```sh-session
pcmd run print-hi
```
It outputs
```text
$ An example of a long command depicting the usage of pcmd!
```

### Running multiple command lines :octopus:
You can also run multiple commands from a single custom command using **pcmd**.  
In `cmd.yaml`,  
```yaml
git-list:
  - git add .
  - git commit -m 'Added feature to run multiple commands'
  - git push
```
> :warning: WARNING: Commands which involve *changes or reload of terminal* (Eg: `cd` and _activating enviroments_ using `/env/Scripts/activate`) **may NOT WORK**. 

Now type,  
```sh-session
pcmd run git-list
```
### `pcmd list` command :blowfish:
This command outputs contents inside `cmd.yaml` file

### For more docs :page_facing_up:
```sh-session
pcmd
```
